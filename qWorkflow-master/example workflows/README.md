#Example Alfred Workflows
 
###iTunes Ratings
An example Alfred workflow file that uses my AppleScript qWorkflow library to show iTunes's rating for the currently playing song and also provides options to rate it differently (and in a funny way).

###Twitter Search
An example Alfred workflow that uses the same qWorkflow library to find the latest world wide tweets in real-time for a given search query using the JSON capabilities provided by this library (note the support for unicode character output).
